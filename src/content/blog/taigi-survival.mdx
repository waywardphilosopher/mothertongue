If you are new to Tâi-gí, then [this article by Wind&Bones's Dr. Will Buckingham](https://www.thedial.world/articles/news/issue-22/taiwanese-hokkien-tai-gi), published by _The Dial_, is a great starting point.

In the article, Will traces the complicated history of Tâi-gí's emergence, decline and revival through the history of Taiwan from the nineteenth to the twenty-first century. The piece features interviews with YouTuber Ayo ([台南妹仔教你講台語](https://www.youtube.com/@a_yo__oy_a)) and with the folks at Gutta Books&Coffee up in Taipei.
