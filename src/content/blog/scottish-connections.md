We are delighted to have been awarded a grant from the Scottish Government's Scottish Connections Fund to take forward our project, Tâigael: A Mother-tongue Manifesto. The Scottish Connections Fund was launched by the Scottish Government in 2023 to support Scotland’s links around the world. It is designed to support new initiatives led by members of Scotland’s international diaspora community, to bring the world to Scotland and to bring Scotland to the world. You can find out more about this year's fund here: [Scottish Connections Fund](https://www.gov.scot/publications/scottish-connections-fund-successful-applicants/).

Although seemingly distant in language, culture, and geography, Taiwan and Scotland share a common experience of language suppression and revival. In this project, we are exploring these common experiences through commissioning new stories from writers in both Scotland and Taiwan. The stories will be published here on this website in March 2025, and in paperback format in June.
