We're very busy behind the scenes perfecting the final proofs of the book. The hard-copy proofs arrived in the mail the other day, and we're working through systematically, as well as getting the recordings for the website finalised.

— Garry MacKenzie, author of _Scotland: a Literary Guide for Travellers_ and _Ben Dorain: a conversation with a mountain_.
