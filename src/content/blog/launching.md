Hello, and welcome! We're delighted to announce the launch of Mother Tongue Manifesto, with the support of a Scottish Connections Fund grant from the Scottish Government.

In this project, we are bringing together four writers working in minoritised languages, two from Scotland and two from Taiwan. Our aim is to explore the linguistic and cultural diversity of both nations. For this project, writers will produce new work in Gaelic and Taiwanese.

Through collaborative online writing workshops and intensive translation, our fabulous team of writers (find out more [here](/whoweare)) will write new works in Gaelic and Taiwanese, and translate these into each other's languages.

We have four writers, four languages (Taiwanese, Gaelic, Mandarin and English), and four stories. Weâ€™re really excited to see what new stories are born out of this collaboration.
