We’ve just heard that we’ve been awarded a small grant from Creative Scotland to add a new dimension to this project, and to record some audio of the writers and translators reading their work. We’re currently putting everything in place for this, and we’re expecting the audio to be published online here in June.

At [Wind&Bones](https://www.windandbones.com), we are writers, and so we love the written word. But we also love language whatever form it lives in. And languages were spoken and sung before they were ever written down. 

There is a pleasure to listening to languages that you know. But there is also a pleasure in listening to languages that you don’t: getting familiar with a new kind of music, the way that meanings and the human body and the coming and going of the breath all converge. So we’re very much looking forward to launching Tâigael Sounds some time around June, so that readers can hear Gaelic and Taiwanese (and Mandarin and English) spoken, to accompany the published stories.
