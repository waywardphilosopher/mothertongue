Today, we are launching the audio recordings of the stories in <em>TÃ¢igael: Stories from Taiwanese & Gaelic</em>, in all four languages: Taiwanese, Gaelic, Mandarin and English.

You can listen free of charge to our star team of writers, translators and editors reading the stories in the collection by going to the [Stories](/stories) page. Click on the writer listen to the audio! It's fascinating to listen to the same story as it moves between Gaelic, Taiwanese, English and Mandarin.

We have a QR code in the book that also takes you straight to the stories, so you can listen and read at the same time! We hope that this will not just enhance the experience of the stories, but will also make the book a useful resource for those learning Gaelic and Taiwanese (or Mandarin and English).
