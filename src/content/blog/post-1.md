Hello, and welcome! We're delighted to announce the launch of our Mother Tongue Manifesto project, with the generous support of a Scottish Connections Fund grant from the Scottish Government.

In this project, we will bring together four writers from Scotland and Taiwan working in minoritised languages, to explore the linguistic and cultural diversity of both nations. For this project, writers will produce new work in Gaelic and Taiwanese (Minnan/Hokkien).

Through collaborative online writing workshops and intensive translation, our fabulous team of writers (find out more [here](/whoweare)) will write new works in Gaelic and Taiwanese, and collaborate on translating these works into each other's languages.

We have four writers, four languages (Taiwanese, Gaelic, Mandarin and Hokkien), and four stories. We're excited to get started!
