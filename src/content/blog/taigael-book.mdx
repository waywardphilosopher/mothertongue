Today, we are delighted to announce the cover of our forthcoming paperback, _Tâigael: Stories from Taiwanese and Gaelic_. The book will be released on 15 June by Wind&Bones Books, in both EPUB and paperback editions.

We love the cover. The two birds are the Taiwan blue magpie (_Urocissa caerulea_), and the raven (_Corvus corax)_, and they represent Taiwan and Scotland respectively. We are big fans of corvids, because they are smart, they are mysterious, and they are beautiful.

The cover below links to our new [Wind&Bones Bookshop](https://books.windandbones.com/product/taigael), where you will be able to buy your copy when the book is released.
