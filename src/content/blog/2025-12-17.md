Yesterday, we were in the beautiful Booboo (不不) arts space in Tainan, at a seminar on the new book platform 3ook.com. It's an innovative approach to local literature, and an attempt to use blockchain technology to make available (and to archive) local literature. It's an attempt to break with standard models of publishing, and to find alternative, decentralised ways of distributing literature that speaks to the experiences of place.

The EPUB of Tâigael is now available for download on the 3ook.com platform. You can go our [Wind&Bones bookshop](https://3ook.com/store?q=windandbones) on the platform to download a copy.

Remember that you can also get hold of the book on our [Wind&Bones Bookshop](https://www.windandbones.com)
