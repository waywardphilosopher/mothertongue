Happy New Year from us at [Wind&Bones](https://www.windandbones.com), and from all of us involved in the Mother Tongue Manifesto project. We're hard at work behind the scenes working on the first drafts of our stories in Gaelic and Tâi-gí. We should have all the first drafts in hand by the 20th of January, after which we will start on the translations from Gaelic to English and from Tâi-gí to Mandarin.

The final versions of the stories will be published later in 2025 in four languages (Gaelic, Tâi-gí, Mandarin and English) in a handsome paperback edition, to be released by Wind&Bones Books. We've been busy working on the new cover design, which we'll be sharing at the end of the month. Keep your eyes peeled (or sign up for our newsletter for updates).
