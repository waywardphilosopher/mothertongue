## Tâigael: translating between Taiwanese and Gaelic

In 2025, the Scottish publisher Wind&Bones have been working with short story writers in Taiwanese (Tâi-gí) and Scottish Gaelic (Gàidhlig), and translating between the two languages, to produce a brand new collection of original fiction in translation. Scotland and Taiwan are both multilingual nations, and have experienced parallel histories of language suppression and revival. In this project, we are foregrounding the work of contemporary writers in both Tâi-gí and Gaelic, and through collaborative translation, exploring these cross-currents.

This project is supported by a grant from the Scottish Government's Scottish Connections Fund, and the audio recordings are supported by a small grant from Creative Scotland.

Our fabulous writers are [Naomi Sím](/naomi) and [Kiú-kiong](/kiukiong) from Taiwan, and from Scotland we have [Lisa MacDonald](/lisa) and [Elissa Hunter-Dorans](/elissa). We have also worked with star translator [Shengchi Hsu](/shengchi). Wind&Bones is co-directed by writers [Dr. Hannah Stevens and Dr. Will Buckingham](/windandbones). Will and Hannah divide their time between Scotland and Taiwan.

Here you can [listen to the stories](/stories), [read the fabulous reviews](/reviews) we have received, or find out more about [resources](/resources) for learning Taiwanese and Gaelic.
