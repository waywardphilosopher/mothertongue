We are a group of writers, translators from Taiwan and Scotland, brought together by Scotland-based social enterprise, Wind&Bones CIC.

We care about language diversity, and believe that telling stories in multiple languages enlarges the world for us all, whatever languages we speak.

In this project, two writers from Taiwan and two writers from Scotland will collaborate on writing and translating four new works, to be published in four languages (Taiwanese Hokkien, Gaelic, Mandarin and English).

This project is produced by Dr. Hannah Stevens (Scotland) and Dr. Will Buckingham (Scotland) from [Wind&Bones](https://www.windandbones.com).
