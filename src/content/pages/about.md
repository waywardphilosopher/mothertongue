## Welcome to _Tâigael: A Mother Tongue Manifesto_

_ Tâigael: A Mother Tongue Manifesto_ is an innovative project, working with short story writers in Taiwanese (Tâi-gí) and Scottish Gaelic (Gàidhlig), and translating between the two languages. The project is produced by the Scottish social enterprise [Wind&Bones](https://www.windandbones.com).

Wind&Bones is co-directed by writers Dr. Hannah Stevens and Dr. Will Buckingham. Hannah and Will divide their time between Scotland and Taiwan.

This project is funded by a grant from the Scottish Government's Scottish Connections fund.

## Why Translate?

We believe in the creative potential of nations that are built on linguistic and cultural diversity. Both Taiwanese and Gaelic have been historically marginalised, and Taiwan and Scotland share many parallel experiences of language suppression and revival. As writers based between Scotland and Taiwan, at Wind&Bones we are excited to explore these parallels.

## Who are Our Writers?

We have amassed an extraordinary group of writers. From Taiwan, we have [Naomi Sím](/naomi) and [Kiú-kiong](/kiukiong). And from Scotland we have [Lisa MacDonald](/lisa) and [Elissa Hunter-Dorans](/elissa).

Our writers are also translators, working to translate each other's work. By the end of the project, each writer will have either translated or will have been translated by every other writer! In this way, we aim to build a strong collective sense of identity for the project.

## What Do We Aim to Do?

We aim to highlight linguistic diversity of both Scotland and Taiwan by exploring translation both _from_ and _into_ minoritised languages. In this way, we want to contribute to expanding the growing canon of literature in both languages.

## What are the Project Outcomes?

### 1. Online Publication

The stories we commission will be published in **four** languages on this website:

- Gàidhlig
- Tâi-gí
- Mandarin
- English

### 2. A New Anthology

We will publish the stories from this project in a new multi-lingual anthology, in book form. The book will be hitting the shelves in mid-2025.
