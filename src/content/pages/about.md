## Welcome to _Mother Tongue Manifesto_

Mother Tongue Manifesto is an innovative project, working with short story writers in Taiwanese (Tâi-gí) and Scottish Gaelic (Gàidhlig), and translating between the two languages. The project is produced by the Dundee-based social enterprise [Wind&Bones CIC](https://www.windandbones.com).

Wind&Bones is co-directed by writers Dr. Hannah Stevens and Dr. Will Buckingham. Hannah and Will divide their time between Scotland and Taiwan.by Wind&Bones CIC We are funded by a small grant from the Scottish Government's Scottish Connections fund.

## Why Translate?

Both Taiwanese and Gaelic are have been been historically marginalised. As writers based between Scotland and Taiwan, at Wind&Bones, we are interested in exploring the parallel experiences of minoritised language speakers in both countries. We believe in the possibility of nations built on linguistic and cultural diversity.

## Who are Our Writers

We have amassed an extraordinary group of writers. From Taiwan, we have (Naomi Sim) and (). And from Scotland we have () and ()

Our writers are also translators, working to translate each other's work. For translation from Mandarin to English, we have additional translation support from Dr. Will Buckingham, and we are currently seeking to commission a translator from English to Mandarin.

By the end of the project, each writer will have either translated or will have been translated by each other writer! In this way, we aim to build a strong collective sense of identity for the project.

## What Do We Aim to Do?

We aim to highlight linguistic diversity of both Scotland and Taiwan by exploring translation both _from_ and _into_ minoritised languages. In this way, we want to contribute to expanding the growing canon of literature in both languages by:

- Commissioning new original works in Tâi-gí and Gàidhlig
- Introducing new translations into Gàidhlig and Tâi-gí.

## What are Our Project Outcomes?

### Online Publication

The stories we commission will be published in **four** languages on our website:

- Gàidhlig
- Tâi-gí
- Mandarin
- English

### A New Anthology

We also aim to publish the stories from this project in a new anthology, in book form. We aim for publication by the end of May 2025.
