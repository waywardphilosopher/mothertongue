Wind&Bones is a social enterprise based in Scotland, but working all around the world. We run projects that use writing, storytelling and philosophy as catalysts for positive social change. We are co-directed by writers Dr. Hannah Stevens and Dr. Will Buckingham.

Hannah has a PhD in creative writing from the University of Leicester. Her debut short story collection *In Their Absence* was published in 2021, and in 2023 was published in Bulgarian, translated by Ana Pipeva. Hannahâ€™s next collection *On the Bodies of Strangers* is forthcoming in 2025, and was shortlisted for the W&A Working Class Writers prize.
 
Will has a PhD in philosophy and an MA in anthroplogy. He writes fiction, non-fiction, and books for children. His most recent, *Hello, Stranger: Stories of Connection in a Divided World* (Granta 2022), was selected as a BBC Radio4 Book of the Week, and has been translated into Korean, Mandarin (simplified) and German.

We currently divide our time between Dundee, Scotland, and Tainan, Taiwan.
