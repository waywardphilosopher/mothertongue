Wind&Bones CIC is a social enterprise based in Scotland, but working all around the world. We run projects that use writing, storytelling and philosophy as catalysts for positive social change. We are co-directed by writers Dr. Hannah Stevens and Dr. Will Buckingham.

We currently divide our time between Dundee, Scotland, and Tainan, Taiwan.
