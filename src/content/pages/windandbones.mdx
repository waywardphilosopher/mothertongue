Wind&Bones is a social enterprise registered in Scotland and working globally. We run projects that use writing, storytelling and philosophy as catalysts for positive social change. We are co-directed by writers Dr. Hannah Stevens and Dr. Will Buckingham.

Hannah has a PhD in creative writing from the University of Leicester. Her debut short story collection _In Their Absence_ was published in 2021, and in 2023 was published in Bulgarian, translated by Ana Pipeva. Hannah’s next collection _On the Bodies of Strangers_ is forthcoming in 2025, and was shortlisted for the W&A Working Class Writers prize.

Will has a PhD in philosophy and an MA in anthroplogy. He writes fiction, non-fiction, and books for children. His most recent book, _Hello, Stranger: Stories of Connection in a Divided World_ (Granta 2022), was selected as a BBC Radio4 Book of the Week. Will's writing has been translated into multiple languages including Korean, Mandarin, German, Polish, Afrikaans, Finnish, Farsi and French. He is also translator in this collection of the stories by Naomi Sím and Kiú-kiong.

We currently divide our time between Dundee, Scotland, and Tainan, Taiwan.
