## Site Design, Content and Copyright

This website is designed using [Astro](https://astro.build). We use a modified version of the [Dante theme](https://astro.build/themes/details/dante/).

## Data privacy

### What personal data we collect and why we collect it

Our approach to data collection is that we collect the minimum amount of data to make this website work, and no more. There are several ways we do this. The main ones are these:

This site runs using Astro, which makes it lightweight and privacy-aware. It does not use cookies by default.

We collect visitor analytics through Plausible, a privacy-focussed GDPR-compliant alternative to Google Analytics. Unlike Google Analytics, Plausible does not track, collect or store any personal data or personally identifiable information.

We use [Beehiiv](https://www.beehiiv.com/) as our newsletter tool. The Beehiiv script uses cookies to function. You can read their privacy policy [here]
(https://www.beehiiv.com/privacy). The newsletter uses double opt-in, so after signing up, you will receive an email to confirm your subscription.

If you contact us through our [Wind&Bones contact form](https://www.windandbones.com/contact), you will share with us your name/pseudonym, email, and the content of any message. The contact form collects minimal information, so nothing is recorded other than these details.

### What rights you have over your data

You can request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for legal or security purposes.
