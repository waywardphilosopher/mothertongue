## Data privacy

### What personal data we collect and why we collect it

Our approach to data collection is that we collect the minimum amount of data to make this website work, and no more. There are several ways we do this. The main ones are these:

This site runs using Astro, which makes it lightweight and very privacy-aware. It does not use cookies by default.

We collect visitor analytics through Plausible, a privacy-focussed GDPR-compliant alternative to Google Analytics. Unlike Google Analytics, Plausible do not track, collect or store any personal data or personally identifiable information.

We collect data from the contact form, including your name/pseudonym, email and the content of any message. The contact form collects minimal information, so nothing is recorded other than these details.

### What rights you have over your data

You can request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for legal or security purposes.
