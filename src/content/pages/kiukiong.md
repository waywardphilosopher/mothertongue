Kiú-kiong (玖芎) is author of the essay collection *I Buried Myself under the Earth* (我把自己埋進土裡), and in 2023 was writer-in-residence at the Taiwan Literature Base.

She has an MA from the Graduate Institute of Taiwan Literature and Transnational Cultural Studies at National Chung Hsing University. Her primary writing language is Tâi-gí. She believes that one’s mother tongue is not only the voice of one's mother, but is also the voice of one's homeland.
